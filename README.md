# arm-32bit-assembler

This repository contains small programs I wrote to get familiar with ARM 32-bit assembly.

Code was made following the [ARM Assembly By Example](https://armasm.com/)

## Requirements

To be able to assemble, link and run the code, one should have a 32-bit ARM processor and a machine with 
the binutils toolchain for target arm-linux-gnueabihf.

## Compile

Every code sample comes with an associated `build.sh` which define commands to assemble and link source code files.

## License

See `LICENSE`.
